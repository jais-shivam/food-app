# food-app
This is a food ordering app in which Swiggy API is used for fetching data.
Config for this app
  - Parcel Bundeler.
  - react-router-dom for navigation.
  - Tailwind for CSS.
  - Jest for testing.
  - Redux Toolkit & Context API for state management.

-In this app, I have created a custom hook "useOnlineStatus". You can find it in the Utils folder.
- A higher-order component (HOC) is also used in the app for the "top-rated" label for restaurant cards with more than 1,000 reviews.
- Shimmer UI enhances the user experience.
- A glimpse of the app is provided below in the screenshots.
